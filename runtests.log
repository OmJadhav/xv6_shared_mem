/u/c/s/cs537-1/ta/tests/3a/../../lint/cpplint.py --extensions c

Syntax: cpplint.py [--verbose=#] [--output=vs7] [--filter=-x,+y,...]
                   [--counting=total|toplevel|detailed] [--root=subdir]
                   [--linelength=digits]
        <file> [file] ...

  The style guidelines this tries to follow are those in
    http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml

  Every problem is given a confidence score from 1-5, with 5 meaning we are
  certain of the problem, and 1 meaning it could be a legitimate construct.
  This will miss some errors, and is not a substitute for a code review.

  To suppress false-positive errors of a certain category, add a
  'NOLINT(category)' comment to the line.  NOLINT or NOLINT(*)
  suppresses errors of all categories on that line.

  The files passed in will be linted; at least one file must be provided.
  Default linted extensions are .cc, .cpp, .cu, .cuh and .h.  Change the
  extensions with the --extensions flag.

  Flags:

    output=vs7
      By default, the output is formatted to ease emacs parsing.  Visual Studio
      compatible output (vs7) may also be used.  Other formats are unsupported.

    verbose=#
      Specify a number 0-5 to restrict errors to certain verbosity levels.

    filter=-x,+y,...
      Specify a comma-separated list of category-filters to apply: only
      error messages whose category names pass the filters will be printed.
      (Category names are printed with the message and look like
      "[whitespace/indent]".)  Filters are evaluated left to right.
      "-FOO" and "FOO" means "do not print categories that start with FOO".
      "+FOO" means "do print categories that start with FOO".

      Examples: --filter=-whitespace,+whitespace/braces
                --filter=whitespace,runtime/printf,+runtime/printf_format
                --filter=-,+build/include_what_you_use

      To see a list of all the categories used in cpplint, pass no arg:
         --filter=

    counting=total|toplevel|detailed
      The total number of errors found is always printed. If
      'toplevel' is provided, then the count of errors in each of
      the top-level categories like 'build' and 'whitespace' will
      also be printed. If 'detailed' is provided, then a count
      is provided for each category like 'build/class'.

    root=subdir
      The root directory used for deriving header guard CPP variable.
      By default, the header guard CPP variable is calculated as the relative
      path to the directory that contains .git, .hg, or .svn.  When this flag
      is specified, the relative path is calculated from the specified
      directory. If the specified directory does not exist, this flag is
      ignored.

      Examples:
        Assuming that src/.git exists, the header guard CPP variables for
        src/chrome/browser/ui/browser.h are:

        No flag => CHROME_BROWSER_UI_BROWSER_H_
        --root=chrome => BROWSER_UI_BROWSER_H_
        --root=chrome/browser => UI_BROWSER_H_

    linelength=digits
      This is the allowed line length for the project. The default value is
      80 characters.

      Examples:
        --linelength=120

    extensions=extension,extension,...
      The allowed file extensions that cpplint will check

      Examples:
        --extensions=hpp,cpp

    cpplint.py supports per-directory configurations specified in CPPLINT.cfg
    files. CPPLINT.cfg file can contain a number of key=value pairs.
    Currently the following options are supported:

      set noparent
      filter=+filter1,-filter2,...
      exclude_files=regex
      linelength=80

    "set noparent" option prevents cpplint from traversing directory tree
    upwards looking for more .cfg files in parent directories. This option
    is usually placed in the top-level project directory.

    The "filter" option is similar in function to --filter flag. It specifies
    message filters in addition to the |_DEFAULT_FILTERS| and those specified
    through --filter command-line flag.

    "exclude_files" allows to specify a regular expression to be matched against
    a file name. If the expression matches, the file is skipped and not run
    through liner.

    "linelength" allows to specify the allowed line length for the project.

    CPPLINT.cfg has an effect on files in the same directory and all
    sub-directories, unless overridden by a nested configuration file.

      Example file:
        filter=-build/include_order,+build/include_alpha
        exclude_files=.*\.cc

    The above example disables build/include_order warning and enables
    build/include_alpha as well as excludes all .cc from being
    processed by linter, in the current directory (where the .cfg
    file is located) and all sub-directories.
